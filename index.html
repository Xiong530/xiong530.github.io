<p>What's up, my name is Andrew and I'm a Comp Sci major in my <strong>6th year</strong> 
    at Sac State. I have a variety of hobbies including fishing, gaming, gymming, and
    more recently, firearms. I just bought a sig sauer p229 for home defense and I enjoy going out and practicing
    on steel plate targets. I also fancy going hunting and being out with nature. An interesting
    fact about me that I enjoy being outdoors so much so, that a career backup I would
    like would to become a Forest Ranger. I think I have good sense of direction and being
    a Forest Ranger would require you to have just that.
